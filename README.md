**Problem:** We see the everlasting issue of people purchasing items, only to never use them again after the first use. Our app, RentShack, aims to mitigate the amount of money wasted on unused items. RentShack will allow users to rent their items out in return for monetary compensation, creating a more efficient way of spending and earning money for both renting and lending parties.
