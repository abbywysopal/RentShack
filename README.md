**Problem:** We see the everlasting issue of people purchasing items, only to never use them again after the first use. Our app, RentShack, aims to mitigate the amount of money wasted on unused items. RentShack will allow users to rent their items out in return for monetary compensation, creating a more efficient way of spending and earning money for both renting and lending parties.

### Goals For This Iteration: 
* ~~Create a login page for users~~
* ~~Create user-base using firebase~~
* Bridge front-end and back-end together to create fully functional login screen
* Also learn Facebook login procedure
